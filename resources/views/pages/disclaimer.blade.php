	      <p>The idea of Health Tourism, as an independent thing, was made popular in the late 1990s.People from the west travelled to countries in Asia mostly for cosmetic surgeries, for practical reasons of efficiency and cost effectiveness. In these two decades, the trend has changed from travel for wellness to a more serious proposition- a wholesome Medical Tourism. The global growth in the flow of patients and health professionals, as well as medical technology across National borders has given rise to new pattern of consumption and production of healthcare services.</p>

	      <p>Few years back, we recognized an acute demand of an agency that could vouch for international logistic solution for individuals who needed to travel on medical grounds. During our long association with social & community service, we felt the need to drastically improve upon the service being provided to the patients. After long   introspection   we thought that why not start a company which provides unmatched service to the patient coming from outside India as they faces a real uphill task in getting his treatment and procedures done. Constituted in 2017,by Mr. Sumit Nandy, Mr. Partho Sen and Mr. Sajal  Roy â€“ SWASTHYA BANDHAV was formed with the aim of providing unmatched healthcare related service to patients who look towards  India for cutting- edge medical treatment at lower cost. SWASTHYA BANDHAV   Strives to find and suggest   the best medical treatment in India and help people to get right attention they need at right price/place. It is strong   willed and customer centric.</p>

	      <p>Our mission at SWASTHYA BANDHAV is to create an environment where medical healthcare is not a luxury but a basic right that can be easily achieved by everyone. No one must feel discouraged from undergoing a treatment because of either a crunch of money or unfamiliarity of a foreign land and language. We   keep a dual focus on cost effectiveness and immaculate of every surgery and treatment that we facilitate. The mission is to be the best medical tourism operator in the country by providing unmatched service. To integrate tourism part in the medical treatment, thereby making the whole business of Medical Tourism become a reality. There is no sense of achievement as big as watching others regain their health and vitality, especially when we have a small role to play in it.</p>

	      <p>The vision is to see this company grow to a level of catering to 1000 patients per month without compromising on service provided.</p>

	      <p>Our involvement with medical fraternity goes beyond that. Through many patients- centric activities such as medical camps, symposium, road show, blood donation camp & social awareness camp related with hygienic, We work with doctors specializing in different fields of medical science, all through the year.</p>
